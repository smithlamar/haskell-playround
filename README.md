# haskell-playround
Fun with Haskell - e.g. practice code and book exercises from Haskell from the Very Beginning (John Whitington) as well as Category Theory for Programmers (Bartosz Milewski). The intent of this repo is to get comfortable with Haskell the language. It is not meant to represent any proper use of Cabal, GHCI, or any other element of a typical Haskell toolchain.
